JIRA VS Trello
<?php 
> Trello is free, JIRA is arguably expensive. JIRA sells into large enterprises and Trello targets small businesses and individual users.

> Trello is a very simple tool - it is not too much more than a very sophisticated “To-Do” list. Jira is a much more robust, full-function Agile Project Management tool with enterprise-level capabilities to roll up data across multiple projects and programs.

Those two tools are in entirely different leagues.

Agile project management methodology
<?php 
Agile Project Management (APM) is an iterative approach to planning and guiding project processes.

Agile Project Management (APM) is an iterative approach to planning and guiding project processes.

Just as in Agile Software Development, an Agile project is completed in small sections. These sections are called iterations. In Agile Software Development, for instance, an iteration refers to a single development cycle. Each section or iteration is reviewed and critiqued by the project team, which should include representatives of the project`s various stakeholders. Insights gained from the critique of an iteration are used to determine what the next step should be in the project.


Agile project methodology breaks down projects into small pieces that are completed in work sessions that run from the design phase to testing and quality assurance (QA). These sessions are often called sprints, the term for iteration used in one specific and popular Agile development method known as Scrum.

Sprints are generally short, running over days or weeks; they`re typically two to four weeks long.

The Agile methodology enables teams to release segments as they`re completed. This continuous release schedule allows for teams to demonstrate that these segments are successful and, if not, to fix flaws quickly. The belief is that this helps reduce the chance of large-scale failures, because there is continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle.

The main benefit of Agile Project Management is its ability to respond to issues as they arise throughout the course of the project. Making a necessary change to a project at the right time can save resources and, ultimately, help deliver a successful project on time and within budget.

In agile projects, it is everyone`s (developers, quality assurance engineers, designers, etc.) responsibility to manage the project to achieve the objectives of the project.
In addition to that, the agile project manager plays a key role in agile team in order to provide the resources, keep the team motivated, remove blocking issues, and resolve impediments as early as possible.

In this sense, an agile project manager is a mentor and a protector of an agile team, rather than a manager.

> Deliveries are short-term. Usually a delivery cycle ranges from one week to four weeks. These are commonly known as sprints.

> Frequent communication is one of the key factors that makes this integration possible.
