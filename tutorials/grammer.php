had and did
<?php 
1.“Did” is the past simple tense of the verb “do” while “had” is the past participle tense of the verb “have.” 2.“Did” is used to refer to something that has already been performed while “had” is used to refer to something that one possessed.

“Did” is used when referring to something that has already been performed or carried out. It refers to an act that has been completed or to something that someone was engaged in. When one finishes a task or job and refers to it later, he would say “He did the job.” 

“Had,” on the other hand, is used to refer to something that someone possessed, accepted, received, held, or has been subjected to. It may refer to a material, a characteristic, an experience, or a quality that one possessed. 

An example is the sentence: “I already had it in my hands, but then it flew away towards the trees.”

Friends, Today I am going to tell u Panchatantra Story.
And today`s story is "Gadhe ne Gaana Gaya"

Once lived a Laundryman in village.
He had a donkey named kalu.
Kalu used to work hard day and night, but he never got enough food to satify his hunger.

The laundryman didn`t intentionally give less food to kaalu. but he was stricken by poverty due to which he couldn`t afford more food for him.

Because of inapt diet Kaalu was getting weaker and thin day by day.
One day, the laundryman succeeding in finding a way to feed Kaalu properly.

The laundryman thought of leaving Kaalu openly at the night to fetch food from the nearby village.
This way he will be able to feed himself aptly.

One night when kaalu was hovering in the farms, he met a Jackal named Pappu.

Both the friends then used to visit numerous farms in the village every night and eat Pumpkins, Green Beggies and grass.

Both the friends began to have lots of fun in the farms of the village.

Pappu tonight feels like heaven.
I am feeling like singing a song under the moonlight.

Pappu flips out listening to this quest of kaalu and says.
Have u lost ur senses brother?
Are u really planning on doing dhenchu-dhenchu and wake up the landlord at this time of night?
It is not the right time to sing.

Why is this not the right time?

This is because the landlord will flip out listening to ur irritating voice and he will beat us both with  STICK.

Nothing will happend,buddy.
You r freaking out for a no reason.
Do u know how many people love my voice?
People used to rave about my singing skills during childhood.

God knows who raved about his singing?

Pappu still tries to convince kaalu.

Kaalur voice isn`t good. Listen to me drop the idea of singing. Else both of us will be in troble.

What do u know about singing?
I`m very good singer.Tonight I am definitely going to sing. No one can stop me.

Okay If u want to sing, then do it, But first, let me get away from here.

Kaalu laughs listening to this statement of pappu n says. 
Ha Ha Ha! Okay u can go away. You aren`t worth of my friendship.

As soon as Pappu leaves, Kaalu begin to sing a song.

Listenning to the annoying sound, the landlord comes running towards kaalu with thick rod and badly beats him.

Kaalu screams loudly but no one comes to save him.

somehow he manages to run and save himself from the landlord. And he meets Pappu on the outskirt of the farm.

Seein kaalu, Pappu tells him.
Kaalu, I told u multiple times to not sing but you didn`t listen.

Had u listened to me you wouldn`t have suffered so much you wouldn`t have suffered so much

kaalu feels ashamed of himself and says You r so right my friend. I ignored ur advice, which is why I am in this situation.

From this story, we learn  LESSON THAT we must always consider a good advice.
