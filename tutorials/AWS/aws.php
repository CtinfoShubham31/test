# What is Cloud Computing?
It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server or personal computer. 
There are basically 3 categories in cloud computing:

=> SaaS (Software as a Service)
It allows companies to use software without having to purchase them, which reduces the expenditure of the company drastically, since they are already installed on the cloud server they can be quickly deployed and therefore saves time.

=> PaaS (Platform as a Service)
It allows developers to build applications, collaborate on projects without having to purchase or maintain infrastructure.

=> IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
It allows companies to rent servers, storage space, etc. from a cloud provider.

When we talk about AWS, it’s more of an IaaS,

# AWS
(1.0) AWS (Amazon Web Service) is a cloud computing platform that enables users to access on demand computing services like database storage, virtual cloud server, etc. 

(1.1) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon’s cloud web hosting platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions. 

(1.2) Amazon Web Services(AWS) is a Amazon.com subsidiary which offers cloud-computing services at very affordable rates, therefore making its customer base strong from small scale companies like Pinterest (which has just 5 employees) to big enterprises like D-Link. 

=============================================================================
# EC2
An EC2 instance is nothing but a virtual server in Amazon Web services terminology. It stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. It is a web service where an AWS subscriber can request and provision a compute server in AWS cloud.
An on-demand EC2 instance is an offering from AWS where the subscriber/user can rent the virtual server per hour and use it to deploy his/her own applications.
The instance will be charged per hour with different rates based on the type of the instance chosen. AWS provides multiple instance types for the respective business needs of the user.
Thus, you can rent an instance based on your own CPU and memory requirements and use it as long as you want. You can terminate the instance when it’s no more used and save on costs. This is the most striking advantage of an on-demand instance.
